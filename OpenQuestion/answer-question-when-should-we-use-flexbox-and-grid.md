# When should we use flexbox and grid?
### Flexbox
Flexbox is best suited for one-dimensional layouts, either a row or a column. It excels in distributing space within items in a container and handling alignment. Use Flexbox when:

- You need a simple, linear layout (either a row or a column).
- The primary concern is the distribution of space among items in a single direction.
- You want to control the alignment of items along one axis.
- You have a dynamic or unknown number of items, such as a navigation bar or a list of items.

**Examples:**
- Centering a single element on a page.
- Creating a horizontal or vertical navigation menu.
- Distributing space between items in a row or column.

### Grid
Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to create complex designs with rows and columns. Use Grid when:

- You need a layout with both rows and columns.
- You want precise control over the placement of items in both dimensions.
- Youâ€™re creating a more complex layout that involves overlapping elements.
- You need to create a layout template with defined rows and columns.

**Examples:**
- Building a full-page layout with header, sidebar, main content, and footer.
- Creating complex grid-based designs like a photo gallery or a dashboard.
- Designing a layout where items need to be precisely placed in specific grid cells.

### Combining Flexbox and Grid
Often, the most effective approach is to combine both Flexbox and Grid. For example, you might use Grid for the overall page layout and Flexbox for aligning items within individual grid areas.

### Practical Examples

**Flexbox Example:**
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between; /* Distributes items evenly */
  align-items: center; /* Aligns items vertically */
}
.item {
  flex: 1; /* Items grow to fill available space */
}
```

**Grid Example:**
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Creates 3 equal columns */
  grid-template-rows: auto; /* Rows adjust to content */
  gap: 10px; /* Adds space between items */
}
.item {
  grid-column: span 2; /* Spans two columns */
}
```

In summary, use Flexbox for simpler, one-dimensional layouts and alignment tasks, and use Grid for more complex, two-dimensional layouts. Combining both can provide the flexibility and precision needed for modern web design.
